# Living Data Structure

Inspired by the research on [Just in Time Data Structures](https://github.com/UBOdin/jitd-cpp)

I wanted to experiment with writing a Rust version and use biological terms to express complex concepts in an intuitive way as an example of [biomimicry](https://biomimicry.org/biomimicry-examples/)
